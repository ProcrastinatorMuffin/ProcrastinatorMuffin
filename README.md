<!--Introduction-->
I'm a 19-year-old Computer Science student at Maastricht University. My coding journey started three years ago with Python, and since then, I've ventured into web development, picking up JavaScript.

While Python will always hold a special place in my heart, I'm currently dreaming of becoming a Rust GigaChad! ðŸ’»ðŸ¦€
